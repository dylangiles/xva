  <h2>The Xva programming language</h2>
</div>

Xva is an interpreted, statically typed programming language, designed to be small, fast, and allow for rapid prototyping. Its syntax is beginner friendly, but also exposes many common and powerful features found in other languages.

Xva started out with us wanting a "playground" to research all sorts of interesting bits and bobs in the world of programming. I thought that reading about programming constructs wasn't enough, we wanted to **do** something with it. As such, Xva borrows lots of things from a variety of languages, both those that the Xva team haved used (or are using) in a professional context, as well as those we are interested in for our own projects.

Xva is still highly experimental. The Xva team is always open to new ideas and contributions, so if you feel like adding something, please go right ahead and submit a PR!
